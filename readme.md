# Flixx App

Movie info application built with vanilla JavaScript that uses **version 3** of the [TMDB 
API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)
This includes the most populr movies and TV shows with detail pages, a search box for movies and shows with full pagination and a slider for movies that are currently playing in theaters. The slider uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) library.
